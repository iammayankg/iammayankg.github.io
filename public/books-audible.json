  "summary": "<p>Described by the Dalai Lama as \u201cone of the greatest thinkers of the age\u201d, Jiddu Krishnamurti has influenced millions throughout the 20th century, including Aldous Huxley, Bertrand Russell, Henry Miller and Joseph Campbell.<\/p> <p>Born of middle-class Brahmin parents in 1895, Krishnamurti was recognized at age fourteen by theosophists Annie Besant and C W Leadbetter as an anticipated world teacher and proclaimed to be the vehicle for the reincarnation of Christ in the West and of Buddha in the East. In 1929 he repudiated these claims and travelled the world, sharing his philosophical insights and establishing schools and foundations.<\/p> <p>Because Krishnamurti had no interest in presenting theories, his thought is far removed from academic philosophy in the analytic tradition, yet his insights remain extremely relevant to contemporary philosophical theories and to those interested in understanding themselves and the world. Rather than a theorist, Krishnamurti is regarded as a seer and a teacher. He perceived inherent distorting psychological structures that bring about a division in the individual's consciousness between \u201cthe observer\u201d and \u201cthe observed\u201d. He believed this division was a potent source of conflict, both within the individual and externally for society as a whole, and offered a way to transcend these harmful structures through a radical transformation in human consciousness. <\/p> <p>This is a collection of Krishnamurti's writings and lectures about the individual in relation to society. He examines the importance of inquiry, the role of the emotions, the relation between experience and the self, the observer/observed distinction, the nature of freedom, and other philosophical ideas.<\/p>",

Without a parachute or advanced weaponry. Something had to change. <\/p> <p>In what doesn't sound like the best plan ever, David decided to overcome his fears by pretending to be a comedian called \"Irish Dave\" for one full year, crashing as many comedy clubs, festivals, and shows as possible. One part of the plan was at least logical: He was already Irish and already called Dave. In one year David went from being deathly afraid of public speaking to hosting a business conference, regularly performing stand-up comedy, and winning storytelling competitions in front of packed houses. He did it by learning from some of the best public speakers in the world: stand-up comedians. <\/p> <p><i>Do You Talk Funny?<\/i> shows how the key principles of stand-up comedy can be applied to your speaking engagements and presentations to make you funnier, more interesting, and better looking (or at least two of the three). Whether you are preparing for a business presentation, giving a wedding toast, defending your thesis, raising money from investors, or simply want to take on something you're afraid of, this book will take you from sweaty to stage-ready. Ten percent of the author's proceeds from this book will go to Arash Bayatmakou via Help Hope Live until he is fully back on his feet and thereafter to one of the many facing the same challenges after suffering severe spinal cord injuries. <\/p>",

Helping him in his search for the answers is Dutch fitness guru Wim Hof, whose ability to control his body temperature in extreme cold has sparked a whirlwind of scientific study. Carney also enlists input from an army scientist, a world-famous surfer, the founders of an obstacle course race movement, and ordinary people who have documented how they have cured autoimmune diseases, lost weight, and reversed diabetes. In the process he chronicles his own transformational journey as he pushes his body and mind to the edge of endurance, a quest that culminates in a record-bending 28-hour climb to the snowy peak of Mt.

  "summary": "<p>How to think clearly, act purposefully, overcome any obstacle, and find peace and happiness along the way.<\/p> <p>Marcus Aurelius (121-180 CE) was one of the few true philosopher-kings in history.<\/p> <p>His father died when Marcus was three. At age fifteen, he was adopted by Emperor Antoninus Pius, putting him in the line of succession; and at 40, Marcus became a reluctant emperor of the Roman Empire.<\/p> <p>Marcus was reluctant because the demands of being emperor - on top of the temptations of wealth and power - seemed incompatible with his true ambition: to be a humble student of philosophy. Over time, though, Marcus worked out a practical philosophy that kept him grounded amidst the stresses and excesses of palace life. That's why his philosophy is so relevant to us today, in the modern world.<\/p> <p><i>The Meditations<\/i> is a collection of Marcus' personal journal entries. They were not intended for publication but to remind Marcus himself of his principles and priorities. As a result, they are intimate, direct, and extremely useful. This new edition is rendered in contemporary English, with a foreword by Sam Torode. A companion volume, <i>The Manual: A Philosopher's Guide to Life<\/i>, is also available from Ancient Renewal.<\/p>",

Discussing not only the history of Jungian analysis but its present and future applications, this book marks a major contribution to the worldwide study of psychoanalysis.<\/p>",

Ouspensky\u2019s <i>In Search of the Miraculous<\/i> has been hailed as the most valuable and reliable documentation of G. I. Gurdjieff's thoughts and universal view. This historic and influential work is considered by many to be a primer of mystical thought as expressed through the work, a combination of Eastern philosophies that had for centuries been passed on orally from teacher to student. Gurdjieff's goal was to introduce the work to the West, and Ouspensky, an established mathematician, journalist, and already the author of <i>Strange Life of Ivan Osokin, Tertium Organum,<\/i> and <i>A New Model of the Universe<\/i>, was the ideal colleague to do it.<\/p> <p>Ouspensky describes Gurdjieff's teachings in fascinating and accessible detail, providing what has proven to be a stellar introduction to the universal view of both men. <i>In Search of the Miraculous<\/i> has inspired great thinkers and writers of ensuing spiritual movements, including Marianne Williamson, the highly acclaimed author of <i>A Return to Love<\/i> and <i>Illuminata<\/i>. In a new foreword, Williamson shares the influence of Ouspensky's book and Gurdjieff's teachings on the New Thought movement and her own life, providing a contemporary look at a timeless classic.<\/p> <p><i>In Search of the Miraculous<\/i> is deftly narrated by Mike Fraser.

  "summary": "<p>The quest for perfection is exhausting and unrelenting. We spend too much precious time and energy managing perception and creating carefully edited versions of ourselves to show to the world. As hard as we try, we can't seem to turn off the tapes that fill our heads with messages like, <i>Never good enough!<\/i> and <i>What will people think?<\/i> <\/p> <p>Why? What fuels this unattainable need to look like we always have it all together? At first glance, we might think its because we admire perfection, but that's not the case. We are actually the most attracted to people we consider to be authentic and down-to-earth. We love people who are real; we're drawn to those who both embrace their imperfections and radiate self-acceptance. <\/p> <p>There is a constant barrage of social expectations that teach us that being imperfect is synonymous with being inadequate. Everywhere we turn, there are messages that tell us who, what, and how were supposed to be. So, we learn to hide our struggles and protect ourselves from shame, judgment, criticism, and blame by seeking safety in pretending and perfection. <\/p> <p>Based on seven years of ground-breaking research and hundreds of interviews, <i>I Thought It Was Just Me<\/i> shines a long-overdue light on an important truth: Our imperfections are what connect us to each other and to our humanity. Our vulnerabilities are not weaknesses; they are powerful reminders to keep our hearts and minds open to the reality that we're all in this together. <\/p> <p>As Dr. Brown writes, \"We need our lives back. It's time to reclaim the gifts of imperfection - the courage to be real, the compassion we need to love ourselves and others, and the connection that gives true purpose and meaning to life.

  "summary": "<p><i>The Antidote<\/i> is a series of journeys among people who share a single, surprising way of thinking about life. What they have in common is a hunch about human psychology: that it\u2019s our constant effort to eliminate the negative that causes us to feel so anxious, insecure, and unhappy. And that there is an alternative \"negative path\" to happiness and success that involves embracing the things we spend our lives trying to avoid. It is a subversive, galvanizing message, which turns out to have a long and distinguished philosophical lineage ranging from ancient Roman Stoic philosophers to Buddhists. Oliver Burkeman talks to life coaches paid to make their clients\u2019 lives a living hell, and to maverick security experts such as Bruce Schneier, who contends that the changes we\u2019ve made to airport and aircraft security since the 9/11 attacks have actually made us less safe. And then there are the \"backwards\" business gurus, who suggest not having any goals at all and not planning for a company\u2019s future. <\/p> <p>Burkeman\u2019s new audiobook is a witty, fascinating, and counterintuitive listen that turns decades of self-help advice on its head and forces us to rethink completely our attitudes toward failure, uncertainty, and death.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Foucault is one of those rare philosophers who has become a cult figure. Born in 1926 in France, over the course of his life he dabbled in drugs, politics, and the Paris SM scene, all whilst striving to understand the deep concepts of identity, knowledge, and power. From aesthetics to the penal system; from madness and civilization to avant-garde literature, Foucault was happy to reject old models of thinking and replace them with versions that are still widely debated today. A major influence on Queer Theory and gender studies (he was openly gay and died of an AIDS-related illness in 1984), he also wrote on architecture, history, law, medicine, literature, politics and of course philosophy, and even managed a best-seller in France on a book dedicated to the history of systems of thought. <\/p> <p>Because of the complexity of his arguments, people trying to come to terms with his work have desperately sought introductory material that makes his theories clear and accessible for the beginner. Ideally suited for the Very Short Introductions series, Gary Gutting presents a comprehensive but non-systematic treatment of some highlights of Foucault's life and thought. Beginning with a brief biography to set the social and political stage, he then tackles Foucault's thoughts on literature, in particular the avant-garde scene; his philosophical and historical work; his treatment of knowledge and power in modern society; and his thoughts on sexuality.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>We know of psychopaths from chilling headlines and stories in the news and movies - from Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy to Hannibal Lecter and Dexter Morgan. As Dr. Kent Kiehl shows, psychopaths can be identified by a checklist of symptoms that includes pathological lying; lack of empathy, guilt, and remorse; grandiose sense of self-worth; manipulation; and failure to accept one\u2019s actions. But why do psychopaths behave the way they do? Is it the result of their environment - how they were raised - or is there a genetic component to their lack of conscience? <\/p> <p>This is the question Kiehl, a protégé of famed psychopath researcher Dr. Robert Hare, was determined to answer as he began his career 20 years ago. To aid in his quest to unravel the psychopathic mind, Kiehl created the first mobile functional MRI scanner to study psychopaths in prison populations. The brains of more than 500 psychopaths and 3,000 other offenders have been scanned by Kiehl\u2019s laboratory - the world\u2019s largest forensic neuroscience repository of its kind. Over the course of <i>The Psychopath Whisperer<\/i>, we follow the scientific bread crumbs that Kiehl uncovered to show that the key brain structures that correspond with emotional engagement and reactions are diminished in psychopaths, offering new clues to how to predict and treat the disorder. <\/p> <p>In <i>The Psychopath Whisperer<\/i>, Kiehl describes in fascinating detail his years working with psychopaths and studying their thought processes - from the remorseless serial killers he meets with behind bars to children whose behavior and personality traits exhibit the early warning signs of psychopathy. <\/p> <p>A compelling narrative of cutting-edge science, <i>The Psychopath Whisperer<\/i> will open your eyes on a fascinating but little-understood world, with startling implications for society, the law, and our personal lives.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Many of us, without even realizing it, are dominated by fear. We might be aware of some of our fears - perhaps we are afraid of public speaking, of financial hardship, or of losing a loved one. Chögyam Trungpa shows us that most of us suffer from a far more pervasive fearfulness: fear of ourselves. We feel ashamed and embarrassed to look at our feelings or acknowledge our styles of thinking and acting; we don\u2019t want to face the reality of our moment-to-moment experience. It is this fear that keeps us trapped in cycles of suffering, despair, and distress. <\/p> <p>Chögyam Trungpa offers us a vision of moving beyond fear to discover the innate bravery, trust, and delight in life that lies at the core of our being. Drawing on the Shambhala Buddhist teachings, he explains how we can each become a spiritual warrior: a person who faces each moment of life with openness and fearlessness. \"The ultimate definition of bravery is not being afraid of who you are,\" writes Chögyam Trungpa. In this audiobook, he offers the insights and strategies to claim victory over fear.<\/p>",

These include \"The Mirror of the Way of Strategy\", which Musashi wrote when he was in his 20s; \"Thirty-five Instructions on Strategy\", and \"Forty-two Instructions on Strategy\", which were precursors to <i>The Book of Five Rings<\/i>; and \"The Way to Be Followed Alone\", which Musashi wrote just days before his death. <\/p> <p>Heard together, these five texts give listeners an unusually detailed, nuanced view of Musashi's ideas on swordsmanship, strategy, and self-cultivation. Tokitsu puts all these writings into historical and philosophical context and makes them accessible and relevant to today's listeners and martial arts students. Tokitsu understands Musashi's writings - and Musashi as a martial artist - unusually well and is able to provide a rare insight into the man and his historical contribution.<\/p>",

It was written as a guide for the samurai Yagyu Munenori, who was a great swordsman and rival to the legendary Miyamoto Musashi. Takuan was a giant in the history of Zen; he was also a gardener, calligrapher, poet, author, adviser to samurai and shoguns, and a pivotal figure in Zen painting. He was known for his brilliance and acerbic wit. In these succinct and pointed essays, Takuan is concerned primarily with understanding and refining the mind - both generally and when faced with conflict. <i>The Unfettered Mind<\/i> was a major influence on the classic manifestos on swordsmanship that came after it, including Miyamoto Musashi's <i>Book of Five Rings<\/i> and Yagyu Munenori's <i>Life-Giving Sword<\/i>. <\/p>",

Thaler has spent his career studying the radical notion that the central agents in the economy are humans - predictable, error-prone individuals. <i>Misbehaving<\/i> is his arresting, frequently hilarious account of the struggle to bring an academic discipline back down to earth - and change the way we think about economics, ourselves, and our world. <\/p> <p>Traditional economics assumes rational actors. Early in his research, Thaler realized these Spock-like automatons were nothing like real people. Whether buying a clock radio, selling basketball tickets, or applying for a mortgage, we all succumb to biases and make decisions that deviate from the standards of rationality assumed by economists. In other words we misbehave. More importantly, our misbehavior has serious consequences. Dismissed at first by economists as an amusing sideshow, the study of human miscalculations and their effects on markets now drives efforts to make better decisions in our lives, our businesses, and our governments. <\/p> <p>Coupling recent discoveries in human psychology with a practical understanding of incentives and market behavior, Thaler enlightens listeners about how to make smarter decisions in an increasingly mystifying world. He reveals how behavioral economic analysis opens up new ways to look at everything from household finance to assigning faculty offices in a new building to TV game shows, the NFL draft, and businesses like Uber. <\/p> <p>Laced with antic stories of Thaler's spirited battles with the bastions of traditional economic thinking, <i>Misbehaving<\/i> is a singular look into profound human foibles. When economics meets psychology, the implications for individuals, managers, and policy makers are both profound and entertaining. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>The 13 chapters of <i>The Art of War<\/i>, each devoted to one aspect of warfare, were compiled by the high-ranking Chinese military general, strategist, and philosopher Sun-Tzu. In spite of its battlefield specificity, <i>The Art of War<\/i> has found new life in the modern age, with leaders in fields as wide and far-reaching as world politics, human psychology, and corporate strategy finding valuable insight in its timeworn words. <\/p> <p>Aidan Gillen - who has learned a thing or two about strategy through his roles as skilled manipulator Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish (<i>Game of Thrones<\/i>) and ambitious politician Tommy Carcetti (<i>The Wire<\/i>) - brilliantly performs this ancient classic. His experience in portraying insightful and, at times, cunning characters makes him a natural fit for this ancient collection of battlefield epigrams whose influence has grown tremendously in the modern world.<\/p>",

Not, that is, until the spring of 2015, when biologist Jennifer Doudna called for a worldwide moratorium on the use of the new gene-editing tool CRISPR - a revolutionary new technology that she helped create - to make heritable changes in human embryos. The cheapest, simplest, most effective way of manipulating DNA ever known, CRISPR may well give us the cure to HIV, genetic diseases, and some cancers and will help address the world's hunger crisis. Yet even the tiniest changes to DNA could have myriad unforeseeable consequences - to say nothing of the ethical and societal repercussions of intentionally mutating embryos to create \"better\" humans. Writing with fellow researcher Samuel Sternberg, Doudna shares the thrilling story of her discovery and passionately argues that enormous responsibility comes with the ability to rewrite the code of life. With CRISPR, she shows, we have effectively taken control of evolution. What will we do with this unfathomable power? <\/p>",

Fascinated by the sport of freediving - in which competitors descend to great depths on a single breath - James Nestor embeds with a gang of oceangoing extreme athletes and renegade researchers. He finds whales that communicate with other whales hundreds of miles away, sharks that swim in unerringly straight lines through pitch-black waters, and other strange phenomena. Most illuminating of all, he learns that these abilities are reflected in our own remarkable and often hidden potential - including echolocation, directional sense, and the profound bodily changes humans undergo when underwater. Along the way Nestor unlocks his own freediving skills as he communes with the pioneers who are expanding our definition of what is possible in the natural world - and in ourselves. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>This is an absorbing account of a dialogue between leading Western scientists and the foremost representative of Buddhism today, the Dalai Lama of Tibet. <\/p> <p>For modern science, the transitional states of consciousness lie at the forefront of research in many fields. For a Buddhist practitioner, these same states present crucial opportunities to explore and transform consciousness itself. This book is the account of a historic dialogue between leading Western scientists and the Dalai Lama of Tibet. Revolving around three key moments of consciousness - sleep, dreams, and death - the conversations recorded here are both engrossing and highly listenable. Whether the topic is lucid dreaming, near-death experiences, or the very structure of consciousness itself, the listener is continually surprised and delighted. <\/p> <p>Narrated by Fajer Al-Kaisi, the book begins with insightful remarks on the notion of personal identity by noted philosopher Charles Taylor, author of the acclaimed <i>Sources of Self<\/i>. This sets the stage for Dr. Jerome Engel, Dr. Joyce MacDougal, and others to engage in extraordinary exchanges with the Dalai Lama on topics ranging from the neurology of sleep to the yoga of dreams. <\/p> <p>Remarkable convergences between the Western scientific tradition and the Buddhist contemplative sciences are revealed. Dr. Jayne Gackenbach's discussion of lucid dreaming, for example, prompts a detailed and fascinating response from the Dalai Lama on the manipulation of dreams by Buddhist meditators. The conversations also reveal provocative divergences of opinion, as when the Dalai Lama expresses skepticism about near-death experiences as presented by Joan Halifax. The conversations are engrossing and highly listenable. Any listener interested in psychology, neuroscience, Buddhism, or the alternative worlds of dreams will surely enjoy <i>Sleeping, Dreaming, and Dying<\/i>. <\/p>",

Ueshiba believed that Aikido principles could be applied to all the challenges we face in life - in personal relationships, as we interact with society, and at work and in business. <\/p> <p>This edition is a much-expanded version of the original miniature edition that appeared in the Shambhala Pocket Classics series. It features a wealth of new material, including a biography of Ueshiba; an essay by John Stevens that presents Ueshiba's views on \"The Art of War versus the Art of Peace\"; newly translated doka, didactic \"Poems of the Way\"; and Ueshiba's own calligraphies. <\/p>",

I just don't want to spend my life thinking about it.\" This was eye-opening. I love this stuff. But most people have better things to do with their precious time. Bridges to build, diseases to cure, treaties to negotiate, mountains to climb, technologies to create, children to teach, businesses to run. <\/p> <p>Unfortunately, benign neglect of things financial leaves you open to the charlatans of the financial world. The people who make investing endlessly complex, because if it can be made complex it becomes more profitable for them, more expensive for us, and we are forced into their waiting arms. <\/p> <p>Here's an important truth: Complex investments exist only to profit those who create and sell them.

  "summary": "<p>When a pseudonymous programmer introduced \u201ca new electronic cash system that\u2019s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party\u201d to a small Online mailing list in 2008, very few paid attention. Ten years later, and against all odds, this upstart autonomous decentralized software offers an unstoppable and globally-accessible hard money alternative to modern central banks. <i>The Bitcoin Standard<\/i> analyzes the historical context to the rise of bitcoin, the economic properties that have allowed it to grow quickly, and its likely economic, political, and social implications. <\/p> <p>While bitcoin is a new invention of the digital age, the problem it purports to solve is as old as human society itself: transferring value across time and space. Ammous takes the listener on an engaging journey through the history of technologies performing the functions of money, from primitive systems of trading limestones and seashells, to metals, coins, the gold standard, and modern government debt. Exploring what gave these technologies their monetary role, and how most lost it, provides the listener with a good idea of what makes for sound money, and sets the stage for an economic discussion of its consequences for individual and societal future-orientation, capital accumulation, trade, peace, culture, and art. Compellingly, Ammous shows that it is no coincidence that the loftiest achievements of humanity have come in societies enjoying the benefits of sound monetary regimes, nor is it coincidental that monetary collapse has usually accompanied the collapse of a civilization. <\/p> <p>With this background in place, the book moves on to explain the operation of bitcoin in a functional and intuitive way. Bitcoin is a decentralized, distributed piece of software that converts electricity and processing power into indisputably accurate records, thus allowing its users to utilize the Internet to perform the traditional functions of money without having to rely on, or trust, any authorities or infrastructure in the physical world. Bitcoin is thus best understood as the first successfully implemented form of digital cash and digital hard money. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin\u2019s real competitive edge might just be as a store of value and network for final settlement of large payments - a digital form of gold with a built-in settlement infrastructure. <\/p> <p>Ammous\u2019 firm grasp of the technological possibilities as well as the historical realities of monetary evolution provides for a fascinating exploration of the ramifications of voluntary free market money. As it challenges the most sacred of government monopolies, bitcoin shifts the pendulum of sovereignty away from governments in favor of individuals, offering us the tantalizing possibility of a world where money is fully extricated from politics and unrestrained by borders. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>There is a logical flaw in the statistical methods used across experimental science. This fault is not a minor academic quibble: It underlies a reproducibility crisis now threatening entire disciplines. In an increasingly statistics-reliant society, this same deeply rooted error shapes decisions in medicine, law, and public policy, with profound consequences. The foundation of the problem is a misunderstanding of probability and its role in making inferences from observations.<\/p> <p>Aubrey Clayton traces the history of how statistics went astray, beginning with the groundbreaking work of the 17th-century mathematician Jacob Bernoulli and winding through gambling, astronomy, and genetics. Clayton recounts the feuds among rival schools of statistics, exploring the surprisingly human problems that gave rise to the discipline and the all-too-human shortcomings that derailed it. He highlights how influential 19th- and 20th-century figures developed a statistical methodology they claimed was purely objective in order to silence critics of their political agendas, including eugenics.<\/p> <p>Clayton provides a clear account of the mathematics and logic of probability, conveying complex concepts accessibly for listeners interested in the statistical methods that frame our understanding of the world. He contends that we need to take a Bayesian approach - that is, to incorporate prior knowledge when reasoning with incomplete information - in order to resolve the crisis. Ranging across math, philosophy, and culture, <i>Bernoulli\u2019s Fallacy<\/i> explains why something has gone wrong with how we use data - and how to fix it. <\/p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.<\/b>  <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>In this madcap journey, a bestselling journalist investigates psychopaths and the industry of doctors, scientists, and everyone else who studies them.<\/p> <p><i>The Psychopath Test<\/i> is a fascinating journey through the minds of madness. Jon Ronson's exploration of a potential hoax being played on the world's top neurologists takes him, unexpectedly, into the heart of the madness industry. An influential psychologist who is convinced that many important CEOs and politicians are, in fact, psychopaths teaches Ronson how to spot these high-flying individuals by looking out for little telltale verbal and nonverbal clues. And so Ronson, armed with his new psychopath-spotting abilities, enters the corridors of power. He spends time with a death-squad leader institutionalized for mortgage fraud in Coxsackie, New York; a legendary CEO whose psychopathy has been speculated about in the press; and a patient in an asylum for the criminally insane who insists he's sane and certainly not a psychopath.<\/p> <p>Ronson not only solves the mystery of the hoax but also discovers, disturbingly, that sometimes the personalities at the helm of the madness industry are, with their drives and obsessions, as mad in their own way as those they study. And that relatively ordinary people are, more and more, defined by their maddest edges.<\/p>",

In this audiobook, Holt offers a painless and playful introduction to many of our most beautiful but least understood ideas, from Einsteinian relativity to string theory, and also invites listeners to consider why the greatest logician of the 20th century believed the US Constitution contained a terrible contradiction - and whether the universe truly has a future.<\/p>",

Between 1942 and 1945 Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of those he treated in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering, but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose.  <\/p> <p>Through every waking moment of his ordeal, Frankl\u2019s training as a psychiatrist lent him a remarkable perspective on the psychology of survival. As a result of these experiences, Dr. Frankl developed a revolutionary approach to psychotherapy known as logotherapy. At the core of his theory is the belief that man\u2019s primary motivational force is his search for meaning. Frankl\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe will to meaning\u201d is the basic motivation for human life has forever changed the way we understand our humanity in the face of suffering.  <\/p> <p>Frankl\u2019s riveting memoir was named one of the 10 Most Influential Books in America after a 1991 survey by the Library of Congress and Book of the Month Club.

His descriptions of his attempts to escape from a self-made tyranny are his great works of art. <p> In <i>Kafka in 90 Minutes<\/i>, Paul Strathern offers a concise, expert account of Kafka's life and ideas and explains their influence on literature and on man's struggle to understand his place in the world.

  "summary": "One of the greatest physicists of the twentieth century, Richard Feynman possessed an unquenchable thirst for adventure and an unparalleled ability to tell the stories of his life. <i>What Do You Care What Other People Think?<\/i> is Feynman's last literary legacy, prepared with his friend and fellow drummer, Ralph Leighton. <p>Among the book's many tales we meet Feynman's first wife, Arlene, who taught him of love's irreducible mystery as she lay dying in a hospital bed while he worked nearby on the atomic bomb at Los Alamos. We are also given a fascinating narrative of the investigation of the space shuttle <i>Challenger<\/i>'s explosion in 1986, and we relive the moment when Feynman revealed the disaster's cause by an elegant experiment: dropping a ring of rubber into a glass of cold water and pulling it out, misshapen.<\/p>",

The transition from an identity of <i>having<\/i> to <i>being<\/i> creates a state of enlightened psychological and spiritual happiness. <p> Fromm observes that the modern person is less a self-reflective being than a composite of data promoted by the mass media, and he encourages us to pursue true self-awareness beyond simple political, ideological, and religious cliches. By learning to be centered in the self, the individual is less swayed by the endless pressures and dissatisfactions of the culture of consumerism.<\/p>",

From the frustration of misplacing your keys to the sadness of losing a loved one, the writings of Seneca can offer consolation. For the particular agony of not having enough money, Epicurus has a solution that everyone can afford. And if your life is beset by difficulty after difficulty, wise advice may be found in the words of Nietzsche, the brilliant philosopher whose own life was riddled with poverty, bad health, and excruciating loneliness. <i>The Consolations of Philosophy<\/i> is smart, lucid, and pleasing, a rare sort of book that wonderfully fulfills the promise of its title.",

As the defiant but sensitive young genius is creating his theory of relativity, a new conception of time, he imagines many possible worlds. In one, time is circular, and people are fated to repeat their triumphs and failures over and over. In another, there is a place where time stands still, visited by lovers and parents clinging to their children. In another, time is a nightingale, sometimes trapped by a bell jar. <\/p> <p>Translated into 30 languages, <i>Einstein's Dreams<\/i> has inspired playwrights, dancers, musicians, and painters all over the world.

British-Iraqi physicist Jim Al-Khalili unveils that legacy to fascinating effect by returning to its roots in the hubs of Arab innovation that would advance science and jump-start the European Renaissance.<\/p> <p>Many of the innovations that we think of as hallmarks of Western science were actually the result of Arab ingenuity: Astronomers laid the foundations for the heliocentric model of the solar system long before Copernicus; physicians accurately described blood circulation and the inner workings of the eye ages before Europeans solved those mysteries; physicists made discoveries that laid the foundation for Newton's theories of optics. But the most significant legacy of Middle Eastern science was its evidence-based approach - the lack of which kept Europeans in the dark throughout the Dark Ages.<\/p> <p>With transporting detail, Al-Khalili places the listener in the intellectual and cultural hothouses of the Arab Enlightenment and tackles two tantalizing questions: Why did the Arab world enter its own Dark Age after such a dazzling enlightenment? And how much did Arabic learning contribute to making the Western world as we know it? Given his singular combination of expertise in both the Western and Middle Eastern scientific traditions, Al-Khalili is uniquely qualified to solve those riddles.<\/p>",

Written as a series of short, lively essays that answer far-ranging questions, <i>How Magicians Think<\/i> describes the making of illusions, the psychology behind them, and the characters who create them. He writes about how technology influences the world of magic; the aesthetics of performance; his contemporaries, including David Copperfield, Penn & Teller, and David Blaine, through a magician\u2019s-eye view; and how magicians hone their craft (Jay spends countless hours in absolute darkness to perfect his sleights of hand). And he answers questions like: Can a magic trick be too good? How did Houdini really die? What happens if a magician reveals a secret? Do magicians ever get fooled? (Yup!) And how do you saw a person in half? (It depends....)<\/p> <p>Compelling, thoughtful, and written by an insider, <i>How Magicians Think<\/i> is a rare excursion into a truly secret world.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>'I can understand myself only in the light of inner happenings. It is these that make up the singularity of my life, and with these my autobiography deals' (Carl Gustav Jung) <\/p> <p>In 1957, four years before his death, Carl Gustav Jung, psychiatrist and psychologist, began writing his life story. But what started as an exercise in autobiography soon morphed into an altogether more profound undertaking. The result is an absorbing piece of self-analysis: a frank statement of faith, philosophy and principles from one of the great explorers of the human mind. <\/p> <p>Covering everything from Sigmund Freud, analytical psychology and Jungian dream interpretation to a forthright discussion of world myths and religions, including Christianity, Buddhism and other religions, these final reflections on an extraordinary life are a fitting coda to the work of Carl Gustav Jung. It was Jung who observed and named key human characteristics such as the introvert, the extrovert, the animus, the anima, and other concepts such as archetypes (the wise old man, the mother), the collective unconscious, the complex and many more. <\/p> <p>His studies took him into many fields - religion, anthropology, archeology and literature - which instructed his clinical work. This extraordinary breadth gave him a view of humanity and of culture that still resonates deeply. <\/p> <p><i>Memories, Dreams, Reflections<\/i> is a remarkable document showing a man of great depth, humility and perspicacity.

'Morality is the herd instinct in the individual.' 'The world is overfull of beautiful things, but it is nevertheless poor, very poor, in beautiful moments.' Being intellectual, he declares, is not equivalent to 'taking things seriously': why not laugh while thinking! <\/p> <p>When should one be an Epicurean and when a Stoic? Nietzsche may be best known for <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra<\/i> (<i>The Gay Science<\/i> was published in 1882, a year before <i>Zarathustra<\/i>, and actually contains its opening paragraph!) but with its potpourri of comments, some wild, some sharp, some rather odd, it is totally different in tone. <i>The Gay Science<\/i> represents the Friedrich Nietzsche one would want to meet. <\/p> <p>All of the 77 poems included by Nietzsche in <i>The Gay Science<\/i> have been placed at the end of the main text, to be enjoyed by dedicated Nietzscheans. <\/p> <p>The aphorisms and poems are persuasively read by Michael Lunts. <\/p>",

Within these sections appear many of his concepts which have found their way into the wider consciousness of modern man - the key role of sex in forming our thoughts and behavior, the Oedipus complex, the libido, sublimation, fixation, regression and suppression and the unconscious. He was determined to show how psychoanalysis could help reveal the causes of neuroses and lead to clarity for the patient - as opposed to the approach taken by psychiatrists. <\/p> <p>Freud refers to his early use of hypnotism, which he later discarded, and many more steps which led him to his conclusions that the powerful part played by sexual impulses, often dating back to childhood, pursued individuals into adulthood. <\/p> <p>Freud's text is well served by a clear presentation from Nigel Carrington.

  "summary": "<p><i>The Psychopathology of Everyday Life<\/i>, which appeared first in 1901 and was then expanded in a series of subsequent editions, has proved to be one of Freud's most popular works, and one of his most influential during his lifetime. It was here that he proposed that many slips and errors of memory common to the average man in everyday life actually signals unconscious issues that beset the individual, and, if examined, can be extremely revealing. Freud opens the work with the following statement: 'During the year 1898 I published a short essay on the Psychic Mechanism of Forgetfulness. I shall now repeat its contents and take it as a starting-point for further discussion. I have there undertaken a psychologic analysis of a common case of temporary forgetfulness of proper names, and from a pregnant example of my own observation I have reached the conclusion that this frequent and practically unimportant occurrence of a failure of a psychic function - of memory - admits an explanation which goes beyond the customary utilization of this phenomenon.' This 'phenomenon' was a personal matter for Freud himself. He observed its frequent and varied appearance as an important tool in his psychoanalytic work. He analyses the subject through 12 chapters, including Forgetting of Proper Names, Foreign Words, Childhood and Concealing Memories, Mistakes in Speech, Reading and Writing, Erroneously Carried-out Actions, and Determinism, Chance and Superstitious Beliefs. <i>The Psychopathology of Everyday Life<\/i> is a key work in psychology and psychoanalysis, yet very accessible. It is presented in a clear and direct manner by Derek Le Page. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>This classic introduction to the psychology of Carl Gustav Jung is important because it is the only English original text he sanctioned in his lifetime. In his personal foreword, he wrote: 'Mrs Frieda Fordham has undertaken the by no means easy task of producing a readable resumé of all my various attempts at a better and more comprehensive understanding of the human psyche. She has delivered a fair and simple account of the main aspects of my psychological work. I am indebted to her for this admirable piece of work.'<\/p> <p>Originally issued in 1953, this <i>Introduction<\/i> immediately became the standard first step for those eager to understand the varied work and thought of this remarkable man. Mrs Fordham explains her reason for attempting the work. She wrote: 'Most people have heard of the late C. G. Jung, often linking him vaguely with Sigmund Freud; and although the terms 'complex', 'introvert', and 'extravert' are often used in everyday speech, few realise they were coined by him. Jung\u2019s influence has been far-reaching, touching many of the human sciences, and his ideas have proved of value in such widely differing fields as biology and theology. Many of his writings are technical, and even those of a general nature often appear somewhat obscure, but they contain a core of significance for everyone. This book aims at revealing this core to the reading public in language which is easily comprehensive and yet does not do violence to the subtlety and creative genius of one of the greatest modern psychologists.'<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>In the 21st century, Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) remains one of the key figures in the field of analytical psychology - and <i>Psychological Types<\/i>, or <i>The Psychology of Individuation<\/i>, published in 1921, is one of his most influential works. It was written during the decade after the publication of <i>Psychology of the Unconscious <\/i>(1912), which effectively ended his friendship and collaboration with Sigmund Freud.<\/p> <p>Whereas the earlier work had clearly marked Jung\u2019s psychoanalytical divergence from Freud it is the <i>Psychology of Types <\/i>that fully clarifies and presents the nature, quality and characteristics of his analytical psychology. <\/p> <p>The work, which was in part a consequence of his need to reconcile the competing theories of Freud, whom he regarded as extraverted, and Alfred Adler, whom he saw as introverted, develops his concept of descriptive categories for understanding the human mind in terms of the two essential attitude types: introversion and extraversion. <\/p> <p>These basic attitudes operate in tandem with four principal interacting functions of consciousness which Jung identifies as sensation and intuition, which are functions of perception, and thinking and feeling, which are functions of judgment. <\/p> <p>The eight resulting psychological types are then explored, described, identified, characterised and explained in considerable detail, with a soaring range of examples drawn from the whole of human history, culture and experience. In his efforts to explore and illuminate the nature of the unconscious mind and indeed the collective unconscious, he investigates the problems posed by the differing psychological types and how these have manifested from classical and medieval times to the 20th century. <\/p> <p>His observations range from Aristotle, Socrates and Plato to Tertullian and Origen, and from Abélard and Master Eckhart to Martin Luther and the problem of transubstantiation. Jung takes the listener on an odyssey of human thinking. He considers the problem of types in the works of Schiller and Goethe, and Spitteler and his treatment of the Prometheus myth. <\/p> <p>He contrasts idealism and realism, the Apollonian and the Dionysian in Nietzsche, and explores a host of philosophical and religious sources from the Bible to Taoism to Brahminism. He considers the nature of the reconciling symbol in Spitteler before analysing the nature of types in modern philosophy, aesthetics and biography, giving detailed consideration to William James\u2019 characteristic pairs of opposites and Furneaux Jordan\u2019s \u2018character sketch of the emotional types\u2019. <\/p> <p>Jung goes on to fully identify and describe the characteristic differences between the extraverted and introverted types and provides an extensive chapter on definitions to fully clarify the meaning of the language he employs and make his meaning more accessible.<\/p> <p>Authoritatively read by Martyn Swain for Ukemi Audiobooks, <i>Psychological Types <\/i>is an inexhaustible treasure chest of ideas and creative inspiration worth listening to time and time again.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p><i>Collected Papers on Analytical Psychology<\/i> comprises a selection of key writings and lectures by Carl Gustav Jung produced between 1902 and 1916, which are presented in chronological order. As such they provide a fascinating exposition of the nature and essence of the psychological content of psychoses and neuroses, as explored and discovered by Dr Jung in the early years of his long and distinguished career. <\/p> <p>The collection opens with \u2018On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena' (1902) - a particular interest of the time; it continues with 'The Association Method' (1909), 'The Significance of the Father in the Destiny of the Individual' (1909), 'A Contribution to the Psychology of Rumour' (1911) and 'On the Significance of Number-Dreams' (1911). Psychoanalysis is specifically dealt with in three chapters, an essay, a lecture and a correspondence all dating from 1913. Other subjects are covered, including dreams and psychoses, and there is an extended essay on 'The Psychology on the Unconscious Processes', (1916, revised in 1917). The collection concludes with 'The Conception of the Unconscious', the lecture given in 1916 to the Zurich School for Psychology, with which Jung had become increasingly identified. <\/p> <p>In a sense these early works could be considered a road map of Jung\u2019s thinking on analytical psychology. In these later chapters (14 and 15) which contain many of Jung\u2019s conclusions, we are given a fascinating description of a journey of investigation and discovery into the workings of the human mind and we can understand how Dr Jung developed his thinking pertaining to the ideas of introversion and extroversion, which have proved to be so essential and influential in the discipline of psychology. <\/p> <p>Jung also explains how, despite their well-documented differences of interpretation and their public falling out, he agrees with Freud that neurosis stems from repression, but he differs with the founder of the Vienna school regarding the origin of repression. Where Freud focused wholly on sexuality, Jung explains repression as resulting from a tendency towards a one-sided adaptation to the demands of life, determined by the extent of any given individual\u2019s degree of introversion or extroversion. He contrasts the approaches of Freud and Adler, characterising them as focusing on infantile hedonism and power-seeking respectively. While accepting that these analyses may well be accurate very often, he ultimately considers them to be too reductive. Interestingly, he by no means rejects the importance of the role of sexuality in these processes, but rather repositions it. He does not accept its exclusivity and focuses on the importance of symbolism in mental life.  <\/p> <p>He regards causality as a point of view and the causal explanation of daily life is considered to be essentially mechanistic, contrasting it with the \u2018final\u2019 viewpoint. He dismisses the Freudian emphasis on the overriding role of sexuality and points out the functional importance of the symbol in the life of the mind and its importance to the further development of humankind. A PDF for download accompanies this recording. It provides detailed diagrams and tables used by Dr Jung as explanatory and supporting evidence for Chapter II, 'The Association Method'.<\/p> <p> <b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.<\/b> <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Of all the books of the Bible, few have had more resonance for modern listeners than the <i>Book of Job<\/i>. <\/p> <p>For a world that over the past century has witnessed horrors the like of which could not have been imagined by earlier generations, Job\u2019s cries of despair and incomprehension are all too recognisable. The visionary psychotherapist Carl Gustav Jung understood this and responded with this remarkable book, in which he set himself face to face with 'the unvarnished spectacle of divine savagery and ruthlessness'. <\/p> <p>Jung perceived in the hidden recesses of the human psyche the cause of a crisis that plagues modern humanity and leaves the individual, like Job, isolated and bewildered in the face of impenetrable fortune. By correlating the transcendental with the unconscious, Jung, writing not as a biblical scholar but 'as a layman and physician who has been privileged to see deeply into the psychic life of many people', offers a way for every listener to come to terms with the divine darkness which confronts each individual. <\/p> <p>Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) founded the analytical school of psychology and developed a radical new theory of the unconscious.

This is Fallon\u2019s account of coming to grips with this discovery and its implications. <\/p> <p>How could he, a happy family man who had never been prone to violence, be a psychopath? How much did his biology influence his behavior?

  "summary": "<p><b>From a former senior advisor to Senator John McCain comes an urgent wake-up call about how new technologies are threatening America's military might.<\/b><\/p> <p>For generations of Americans, our country has been the world's dominant military power. How the US military fights, and the systems and weapons that it fights with, have been uncontested. That old reality, however, is rapidly deteriorating. America's traditional sources of power are eroding amid the emergence of new technologies and the growing military threat posed by rivals such as China. America is at grave risk of losing a future war.<\/p> <p>As Christian Brose reveals in this urgent wake-up call, the future will be defined by artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, and other emerging technologies that are revolutionizing global industries and are now poised to overturn the model of American defense. This fascinating, if disturbing, book confronts the existential risks on the horizon, charting a way for America's military to adapt and succeed with new thinking as well as new technology. America must build a battle network of systems that enables people to rapidly understand threats, make decisions, and take military actions, the process known as \"the kill chain.\" Examining threats from China, Russia, and elsewhere, <i>The Kill Chain<\/i> offers hope and, ultimately, insights on how America can apply advanced technologies to prevent war, deter aggression, and maintain peace<\/p>",

She invites us to explore the paradoxical union of domesticity and sexual desire, and explains what it takes to bring lust home. <\/p> <p>In her 20 years of clinical experience, Perel has treated hundreds of couples whose home lives are empty of passion. They describe relationships that are open and loving, yet sexually dull. What is going on? <\/p> <p>In this explosively original book, Perel explains that our cultural penchant for equality, togetherness, and absolute candor is antithetical to erotic desire for both men and women. Sexual excitement doesn't always play by the rules of good citizenship. It is politically incorrect. It thrives on power plays, unfair advantages, and the space between self and other. More exciting, playful, even poetic sex is possible, but first we must kick egalitarian ideals and emotional housekeeping out of our bedrooms. <\/p> <p>While <i>Mating in Captivity<\/i> shows why the domestic realm can feel like a cage, Perel's take on bedroom dynamics promises to liberate, enchant, and provoke. Flinging the doors open on erotic life and domesticity, she invites us to put the \"X\" back in sex.<\/p>",

At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in 18th-century England, standards of measurement were established, giving way to the development of machine tools - machines that make machines. Eventually, the application of precision tools and methods resulted in the creation and mass production of items from guns and glass to mirrors, lenses, and cameras - and eventually gave way to further breakthroughs, including gene splicing, microchips, and the Hadron Collider.<\/p> <p>Simon Winchester takes us back to origins of the Industrial Age, to England where he introduces the scientific minds that helped usher in modern production: John Wilkinson, Henry Maudslay, Joseph Bramah, Jesse Ramsden, and Joseph Whitworth. It was Thomas Jefferson who later exported their discoveries to the fledgling United States, setting the nation on its course to become a manufacturing titan. Winchester moves forward through time, to today\u2019s cutting-edge developments occurring around the world, from America to Western Europe to Asia.<\/p> <p>As he introduces the minds and methods that have changed the modern world, Winchester explores fundamental questions. Why is precision important? What are the different tools we use to measure it? Who has invented and perfected it? Has the pursuit of the ultra-precise in so many facets of human life blinded us to other things of equal value, such as an appreciation for the age-old traditions of craftsmanship, art, and high culture? Are we missing something that reflects the world as it is, rather than the world as we think we would wish it to be? And can the precise and the natural co-exist in society?<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>We are in the midst of a powerful psychedelic renaissance. After four decades of hibernation, the promise of the psychoactive 60s - that deeper self-awareness, achieved through reality-bending substances and practices, will lead to greater external harmony - is again gaining a major following. The signs are everywhere, from the influence of today's preeminent psychedelic thinker Daniel Pinchbeck, to the renewed interest in the legacy of Terence McKenna, and to the upsurge of collective, inclusive (and overtly tripped-out) cultural phenomena like the spectacle of Burning Man. <\/p> <p><i>The Psychedelic Experience<\/i>, created in the movement's early years by the prophetic shaman-professors Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner, and Richard Alpert (Ram Dass), is a foundational text that serves as a model and a guide for all subsequent mind-expanding inquiries. In this wholly unique book, the authors provide an interpretation of an ancient sacred manuscript, The Tibetan Book of the Dead, from a psychedelic perspective. <i>The Psychedelic Experience<\/i> describes their discoveries in broadening spiritual consciousness through a combination of Tibetan meditation techniques and psychotropic substances. <\/p> <p>As sacred as the text it reflects, <i>The Psychedelic Experience<\/i> is a guidebook to the wilderness of mind and an indispensable resource from the founding fathers of psychedelia. <\/p>",

Easwaran's introduction places the Gita in its historical setting and brings out the universality and timelessness of its teachings. Chapter introductions give clear explanations of key concepts in that chapter. To listen to the scripture without the introductions, listeners should start at track 044. The Bhagavad Gita opens dramatically on a battlefield, as the warrior Arjuna turns in anguish to his spiritual guide, Sri Krishna, for answers to the fundamental questions of life. But as Easwaran points out, the Gita is not what it seems - it's not a dialogue between two mythical figures at the dawn of Indian history. \"The battlefield is a perfect backdrop, but the Gita's subject is the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage\" to live a life that is meaningful, fulfilling, and worthwhile. This audio recording is a complete and unabridged reading of Eknath Easwaran's book The Bhagavad Gita. <\/p> <p>Narrated by Paul Bazely, an actor of Indian heritage and a longtime student of Easwaran.

There is an alternative to this potentially dire situation. Humanity now, perhaps more than in any previous time, has an opportunity to create a new, saner, more loving world. This will involve a radical inner leap from the current egoic consciousness to an entirely new one. <\/p> <p>In illuminating the nature of this shift in consciousness, Tolle describes in detail how our current ego-based state of consciousness operates. Then gently, and in very practical terms, he leads us into this new consciousness.

What does it mean for time to \"flow\"? Do we exist in time or does time exist in us? In lyric, accessible prose, Carlo Rovelli invites us to consider questions about the nature of time that continue to puzzle physicists and philosophers alike.<\/p> <p>For most this is unfamiliar terrain. We all experience time, but the more scientists learn about it, the more mysterious it remains. We think of it as uniform and universal, moving steadily from past to future, measured by clocks. Rovelli tears down these assumptions one by one, revealing a strange universe where at the most fundamental level time disappears. He explains how the theory of quantum gravity attempts to understand and give meaning to the resulting extreme landscape of this timeless world. Weaving together ideas from philosophy, science and literature, he suggests that our perception of the flow of time depends on our perspective, better understood starting from the structure of our brain and emotions than from the physical universe.<\/p> <p>Already a bestseller in Italy, and written with the poetic vitality that made <i>Seven Brief Lessons on Physics<\/i> so appealing, <i>The Order of Time<\/i> offers a profoundly intelligent, culturally rich, novel appreciation of the mysteries of time.<\/p>",

Conflict between humans and machines is seen as inevitable and its outcome all too predictable.<\/p> <p>In this groundbreaking audiobook, distinguished AI researcher Stuart Russell argues that this scenario can be avoided, but only if we rethink AI from the ground up. Russell begins by exploring the idea of intelligence in humans and in machines. He describes the near-term benefits we can expect, from intelligent personal assistants to vastly accelerated scientific research, and outlines the AI breakthroughs that still have to happen before we reach superhuman AI. He also spells out the ways humans are already finding to misuse AI, from lethal autonomous weapons to viral sabotage.<\/p> <p>If the predicted breakthroughs occur and superhuman AI emerges, we will have created entities far more powerful than ourselves. How can we ensure they never, ever, have power over us? Russell suggests that we can rebuild AI on a new foundation, according to which machines are designed to be inherently uncertain about the human preferences they are required to satisfy. Such machines would be humble, altruistic, and committed to pursue our objectives, not theirs. This new foundation would allow us to create machines that are provably deferential and provably beneficial.<\/p>",

From the invention of scripts and alphabets to the long-misunderstood talking drums of Africa, Gleick tells the story of information technologies that changed the very nature of human consciousness. He provides portraits of the key figures contributing to the inexorable development of our modern understanding of information: Charles Babbage, the idiosyncratic inventor of the first great mechanical computer; Ada Byron, the brilliant and doomed daughter of the poet, who became the first true programmer; pivotal figures like Samuel Morse and Alan Turing; and Claude Shannon, the creator of information theory itself. And then the information age arrives. Citizens of this world become experts willy-nilly: Aficionados of bits and bytes. And we sometimes feel we are drowning, swept by a deluge of signs and signals, news and images, blogs and tweets. The Information is the story of how we got here and where we are heading.<\/p>",

The great psychologist dreamed that his work was understood by a wide public, rather than just by psychiatrists, and therefore he agreed to write and edit this fascinating book. Here, Jung examines the full world of the unconscious, whose language he believed to be the symbols constantly revealed in dreams. Convinced that dreams offer practical advice, sent from the unconscious to the conscious self, Jung felt that self-understanding would lead to a full and productive life. Thus, the listener will gain new insights into himself from this thoughtful volume, which also illustrates symbols throughout history. Completed just before his death by Jung and his associates, it is clearly addressed to the general listener.<\/p> <p><b>Praise for <\/b><b><i>Man and His Symbols<\/i><\/b><b>:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u201cThis book, which was the last piece of work undertaken by Jung before his death in 1961, provides a unique opportunity to assess his contribution to the life and thought of our time, for it was also his first attempt to present his life-work in psychology to a non-technical public.... What emerges with great clarity from the book is that Jung has done immense service both to psychology as a science and to our general understanding of man in society, by insisting that imaginative life must be taken seriously in its own right, as the most distinctive characteristic of human beings.\u201d (<\/b><b><i>Guardian<\/i><\/b><b>)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u201cStraightforward to read and rich in suggestion.\u201d (John Barkham, <\/b><b><i>Saturday Review Syndicate<\/i><\/b><b>)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u201cThis book will be a resounding success for those who read it.\u201d (<\/b><b><i>Galveston News-Tribune<\/i><\/b><b>)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u201cA magnificent achievement.\u201d (<\/b><b><i>Main Currents<\/i><\/b><b>)<\/b><\/p> <p><b>\u201cFactual and revealing.\u201d (<\/b><b><i>Atlanta Times<\/i><\/b><b>)<\/b><\/p>",

As Oxford academic and bestselling author of <i>The Wisdom of Psychopaths<\/i>, Kevin Dutton has plenty of experience of psychopaths, but he'd never met anyone quite like Andy McNab, decorated war hero and special forces warrior. And although they took very different paths on their roads through life, their personal stories are remarkably similar. <\/p> <p>Together they decided to explore the subject of the psychopathic condition using a unique combination of McNab's personal experiences of 20 years in the army and Dutton's ability to analyse them. In their words, McNab pulls the trigger, Dutton explains why the gun goes bang! <\/p> <p>This audiobook sets out to answer two main questions: What is a good psychopath? And how can you use the positive attributes of that psychology to be the 'best that you can be' In order to do so, they have created a Psychopath Manifesto, an alternative set of rules for life, which begins by asking 'what do you really want from life' and 'what does success look like to you'? It then offers a candid and penetrating insight into those questions viewed using Dutton's expertise through the prism of Andy McNab's wild and various career. It aims to provide an unusual and entertaining roadmap to self-fulfillment whether in your personal life, your business life or your social life<\/p>",

Because they realize that the most valuable wisdom is timeless and that philosophy is for living a better life, not a classroom exercise. <\/p> <p><i>The Daily Stoic<\/i> offers a daily devotional of Stoic insights and exercises, featuring all-new translations from Emperor Marcus Aurelius, playwright Seneca, and slave-turned-philosopher Epictetus as well as lesser-known luminaries like Zeno, Cleanthes, and Musonius Rufus. Every day of the year, you'll find one of their pithy, powerful quotations as well as historical anecdotes, provocative commentary, and a helpful glossary of Greek terms. By following these teachings over the course of a year (and, indeed, for years to come), you'll find the serenity, self-knowledge, and resilience you need to live well. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Most people are both repelled and intrigued by the images of cold-blooded, conscienceless murderers that increasingly populate our movies, television programs, and newspaper headlines. With their flagrant criminal violation of society's rules, serial killers like Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy are among the most dramatic examples of the psychopath. Individuals with this personality disorder are fully aware of the consequences of their actions and know the difference between right and wrong, yet they are terrifyingly self-centered, remorseless, and unable to care about the feelings of others. Perhaps most frightening, they often seem completely normal to unsuspecting targets. Presenting a compelling portrait of these dangerous men and women based on 25 years of distinguished scientific research, Dr. Robert D. Hare vividly describes a world of con artists, hustlers, rapists, and other predators who charm, lie, and manipulate their way through life. Are psychopaths mad, or simply bad? How can they be recognized? And how can we protect ourselves? This book provides solid information and surprising insights for anyone seeking to understand this devastating condition.<\/p>",

Japanese cleaning consultant Marie Kondo takes tidying to a whole new level, promising that if you properly simplify and organize your home once, you'll never have to do it again. Most methods advocate a room-by-room or little-by-little approach, which doom you to pick away at your piles of stuff forever. The KonMari Method, with its revolutionary category-by-category system, leads to lasting results. In fact, none of Kondo's clients have lapsed (and she still has a three-month waiting list).With detailed guidance for determining which items in your house \"spark joy\" (and which don't), this international bestseller featuring Tokyo's newest lifestyle phenomenon will help you clear your clutter and enjoy the unique magic of a tidy home-and the calm, motivated mindset it can inspire.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>From Napoleon's revolutionary campaigns to the way insurgency, terrorism, and nuclear weaponry have defined the nature of warfare in the 21st century, the results of military strategy have changed the course of history. These 24 thought-provoking lectures give you an inside look at both the content and historical context of the world's greatest war strategists. <\/p> <p>From the <i>triremes<\/i> and <i>hoplites<\/i> of ancient Greece to the Special Forces in 21st-century Afghanistan, strategy is the process by which political objectives are translated into military action - using the means at a nation's disposal to compel an enemy to bend to its political will. <\/p> <p>In this concise and rigorous survey, Professor Wilson introduces: Thucydides' <i>History of the Peloponnesian War<\/i>; Sun Tzu's famous <i>The Art of War<\/i>; Machiavelli's strategy for a republic with a citizen-army; Jomini, Clausewitz, and the Napoleonic revolution in warfare; the development of naval strategy and the rise of airpower; Mao Tse-tung, David Galula, and Roger Trinquier's reflections on insurgency and counterinsurgency and their influence on the U.S. Army's Field Manual 3-24; Just-war theory, from Thucydides' Melian Dialogue to Operation Iraqi Freedom; nuclear war, terrorism, and other strategic challenges for the 21st century. <\/p> <p>You'll come away from this course with new insight that will allow you to take an informed, active interest in political and military debates - which ultimately will determine the course of our nation. <\/p> <p>Disclaimer: The views expressed in this course are those of the professor and do not necessarily reflect the position or policy of the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.<\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>What is life? What is my place in it? What choices do these questions obligate me to make? More than a half-century after it burst upon the intellectual scene - with roots that extend to the mid-19th century - Existentialism's quest to answer these most fundamental questions of individual responsibility, morality, and personal freedom has continued to exert a profound attraction. <\/p> <p>Now, in a series of 24 probing and thoughtful lectures, you can enrich your own understanding of this unique philosophical wave, the visionary thinkers it brought together to ponder and debate these questions, and the prominent role it still plays in contemporary thought. <\/p> <p>\"Existentialism is, in my view, the most exciting and important philosophical movement of the past century and a half,\" says Professor Solomon. \"Fifty years after the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre gave it its identity and 150 years after the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard gave it its initial impetus, it continues to win new enthusiasts and, in keeping with its still exciting and revolutionary message, vehement critics.\" Plumbing both sides of the debate, these lectures examine a wide range of Existentialist thought. You'll be exposed to the religious approach of Kierkegaard; the bold fiction of Camus; the warrior rhetoric and often-shocking claims about religion and morality posed by Nietzsche; the radical and uncompromising notion of freedom championed by Sartre; and the searching analysis of human historicity and finitude offered by Martin Heidegger. And you'll encounter the reluctance - often angrily expressed - of many of Existentialism's major figures to be thought of as part of any philosophical movement or even as intellectual allies!<\/p>",

It is the process of attentively observing your experience as it unfolds, without judgment or evaluation.\" <\/p> <p>\"Meditation,\" he adds, \"refers to certain exercises that can be used to enlarge and refine mindfulness.\" Meditation cultivates mindfulness by training you to develop deep attention to the present moment, allowing the mind to become settled and centered. These 24 detailed lectures teach you the principles and techniques of sitting meditation, the related practice of walking meditation, and the highly beneficial use of meditative awareness in many important activities, including eating and driving. You will also learn how to use the skills of meditation in working with thoughts and emotional states, in deepening sensory awareness of the body, and in becoming deeply attentive to the operation of your mind. <\/p> <p>You'll come away with a solid basis for your own meditation practice and for bringing meditation's remarkable and empowering benefits to every aspect of your life. <\/p>",

  "summary": "<p>Who was Friedrich Nietzsche? This lonely and chronically ill, yet passionate, daring, and complex man is perhaps the most mysterious and least understood of all contemporary philosophers. Why are his brilliant insights so relevant for today? How did he become the most misinterpreted and unfairly maligned intellectual figure of the last two centuries? <\/p> <p>To provide shape to Nietzsche's thought, each of these 24 lectures focuses on specific ideas that preoccupied Nietzsche while tracing the profound themes that give meaning to his work. You'll get a chance to put Nietzsche's life and work in a larger historical and philosophical context. You'll explore the controversial philosopher's subtle, complex critique of both religious belief and Greek rationalism. <\/p> <p>You'll also spend a wealth of time focusing on Nietzsche's famous writing style, which deftly combines the majesty of the prophet, the force of the Homeric warrior, and the lyricism of the poet - but which nonetheless is rife with inconsistencies, exaggerations, and personal attacks. And you'll get a better understanding of Nietzsche's complaints and criticisms of the intellectual currents of his time: Christian moralism, evolution, socialism, democracy, and nationalism. <\/p> <p>As you make your way through these lectures, you'll discover that Nietzsche, even at his most polemical and offensive, exudes an unmistakable enthusiasm and love of life. In fact, you'll see that his exhortation to learn to love and accept one's own life, to make it better by becoming who one really is, forms the project that is the true core of his work.<\/p>",

In human terms, spoken language, writing, art, music, and mathematics are perfect examples; so are Morse code, Mendelian genetics, and radio signals - all understood and used before 1900. But a series of conceptual breakthroughs in the 20th century united what seemed like unrelated phenomena and led to a dramatic new way of looking at reality. Called information theory, this field has been responsible for path-breaking insights.<\/p> <p><i>The Science of Information: From Language to Black Holes<\/i> covers the exciting concepts, history, and applications of information theory in 24 challenging and eye-opening half-hour lectures taught by Professor Benjamin Schumacher of Kenyon College.

Instead of counting sheep, I found myself counting people going up a mountain to see a holy man. Each night, semiconscious, I came to know this holy man and the pilgrims. <\/i><\/p> <p><i>My insomnia problem was solved. Now I had a story to write. I wrote it quickly, although years later, when asked how long it took to write, I said 50 years, which was also true. <\/i><\/p> <p><i>Recently the Dalai Lama said, 'You don't have to believe in God to be a kind and compassionate person.' Joe, our man on the mountaintop, would agree. <\/i> <\/p>",

Ever skeptical and full of questions, Arkin embarked on a spiritual journey to find something\u2014anything\u2014to believe in. An existential crisis in his 30s led him to the study of Eastern philosophy. Soon he began opening himself to the possibility that there was more to life than what he had simply seen, heard, or been taught.<\/p> <p>In this Audible Original \"mini-memoir,\" the 84-year-old actor shares his powerful spiritual experiences, from his brush with reincarnation to the benefits of meditation. In a gruff, earthy voice that sounds more suited to a New York cabbie than a spiritual guide, he shows us that wisdom can come from the most unexpected places and teachers. <i>Out of My Mind<\/i> is a candid, relatable, and delightfully irreverent take on how one man went searching for meaning and ended up discovering himself. <\/p>",
